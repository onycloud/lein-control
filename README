# lein-control

A leiningen plugin for clojure-control.
(https://github.com/killme2008/clojure-control).

## Usage

Include the plugin in your project.clj

    (defproject YOUR-PROJECT-NAME "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
        :dev-dependency [[lein-control "0.1.0"]])

Create a control file in your project home, named as `control.clj`.
If you have a custom name for this file, you have to add the config 
option in your project.clj

    :control {:control-file "YOUR-FILE-NAME"}

You can find a sample control file in clojure-control project.
The differences are:

* you don't have to add any (ns) (require) for lein-control
* you SHOULD NOT add (begin) in this file, lein-control will add it for you.

Now, you can run your task with:

    lein control your-cluster your-task [args...]
